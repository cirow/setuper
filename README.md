# setuper.sh
Installer/Updater script for some annoying applications. It only runs on ubuntu 18.04+ (the one I use).

**This is not a package manager**, it's just a interface for some install scripts I wrote to keep some software updated.

Install instructions:

`sudo sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirow/setuper/master/install-setuper.sh -O -)"`


After that, just run `sudo setuper help` for more instructions.
